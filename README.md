# Surfs_Up

## Overview
For this project I was provided with a SQLlite database holding data related to weather stations and data they have gathered. Using this information, I evaluated the data related to precipitation and temperatures in Hawaii. Using this data to determine if starting a surf and ice cream shop in a certain location would be viable. Specifically, temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results
After completing the necessary analysis of data for the months of June and December, there were some noticeable differences. Outlined below are some of the observations.

 - Approximately four degrees difference in the average temperature with June being warmer.
 - Low temperatures are 8 degrees cooler in the month of December. 
 - Number of temperature readings in December are 183 less than Junes.

## Summary
Overall, there is little difference in the temps between the two months. Which would lead me to gathering additional information to make a good recommendation on whether the business is sustainable year-round. Some additional analysis one would want to consider would be:

1. Average water temperatures between the two months.
2. Average rainfall between the two months.
3. Average time of daylight.

With this additional information one should be able to make a good informed decision.
